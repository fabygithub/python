text block
example : print "This is a good string"
(“) 
(‘)
are both acceptable ways to define a string

We can combine multiple strings using +, like so:
print "This is " + "a good string"

Instructions
Try adding your name to the print statement with the + operator so that this Python program prints “Hello [your_name]”

print "Hello " + "jack"
