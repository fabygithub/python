errors and exceptions

so it is a good habit to read and understand them.

print("How do you make a hot dog stand?')
print(You take away its chair!)

  File "script.py", line 1
  print("How do you make a hot dog stand?')
                                            ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

your code has an error in its syntax
because the line ended (called an EOL)

The program will abruptly stop running with the following message:

Python found what it thinks is a command, 
but doesn’t know what it means because it’s not defined anywhere.

Instructions

We’ve written two print statements that will raise errors. 
One has mismatched quotes =  " ' 

and the other has no quotes at all. = without quotes

Fix the two print statements to successfully debug the program!
